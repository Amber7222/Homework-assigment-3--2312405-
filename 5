# the summary shows that the mean of recommendations followed is 0.4542 meaning on average around 45% of participants followed the recommendations
# for the variables Competent, Intelligent, and Thoughtful have mean values around 5-6, indicating that respondents generally rated the recommend-er moderately to highly in these aspects.

# Running ordinal regression to analyze how recommendation modality affects whether or not a recommendation is followed.
# I chose ordinal regression Since the outcome variable (RecommendationFollowed) is binary (0 or 1), logistic regression is a suitable choice for modeling.
model <- glm(RecommendationFollowed ~ Mode + Gender + Age + Competent + Intelligent + Thoughtful + CompositeIntellect + Stimulus,

# summary of model
# The results of this model show there is a negative relationship between presenting recommendations visually and the likelihood of them being followed.
# The effect of gender is not statistically significant (p-value > 0.05).The effect of age is not statistically significant (p-value > 0.05).
# the Competent, Intelligent, and Thoughtful variables have extremely large coefficients (around -8.942e+06), but their p-values are not significant (p-value > 0.05). Itâ€™s likely that these coefficients are not practically meaningful.
